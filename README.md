# Washington Home Price Prediction Application


The project is aimed at creating an application that will help users get a prediction of home prices based in the state of Washington. The application will be hosted on a cloud platform called Streamlit for access at any given time. The application will provide the user with options to input parameters such as desired square feet, desired bedroom count, desired bathroom count, desired floor count, and city. 


All these parameters combined will provide the final price prediction to the user. The coding part will be done in python for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and model building. Streamlit library in python will be used in developing the graphical user interface along with the functions to call the data, model, and user inputs.
